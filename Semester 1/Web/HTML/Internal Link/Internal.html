        CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is an integral part of modern web development. It gives life to otherwise plain HTML structures by defining how elements appear on the screen. 
        Through CSS, developers can ensure their websites are visually engaging, consistent across devices, and responsive to user interactions.
    </p>

        <h2>Introduction to CSS</h2>
        <p>
            CSS is a styling language that describes the visual presentation of a web page written in HTML. It is designed to separate the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), 
            making it easier to manage and maintain the overall look and feel of a website. This separation also allows developers to reuse CSS across multiple pages or projects, 
            saving both time and effort.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the key features of CSS is its ability to cascade. Cascading refers to how style rules are applied based on specificity and priority. For instance, inline styles take 
            precedence over internal or external stylesheets, but external stylesheets are often preferred for better maintainability and reusability. This flexibility is what makes CSS a 
            powerful tool in web design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, CSS has evolved significantly. From its basic functionalities in the 1990s to the introduction of advanced features like animations, grids, and custom variables, 
            CSS has become indispensable for creating modern, user-friendly websites. Whether you're building a static page or a complex web application, CSS plays a crucial role in shaping 
            the user experience.
        </p>
    </div>

        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation of HTML documents. Unlike HTML, which defines the structure and content of a web page, 
            CSS is all about appearance â€” how elements look, how they are positioned, and how they interact with users.
        </p>
        <p>
            At its core, CSS consists of selectors, properties, and values. Selectors target specific HTML elements, while properties and values define the styles to apply. For example:
            <pre>
                p {
                    color: blue;
                    font-size: 16px;
                }
            </pre>
            This rule applies blue color and a font size of 16 pixels to all paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) elements in a document.
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS also introduces various concepts that make it highly versatile. With the introduction of media queries, developers can create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. 
            The use of pseudo-classes like <code>:hover</code> and <code>:focus</code> allows for interactive styles, while animations and transitions bring dynamic effects to web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, CSS can be extended with pre-processors like Sass and Less, which add functionalities such as variables, nested rules, and mixins, making the code more efficient and maintainable.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="third">
        <h2>How Does CSS Work?</h2>
        <p>
            CSS works by applying style rules to HTML elements. These rules consist of a selector, a declaration block, and one or more declarations. A declaration block includes property-value pairs that specify 
            how the targeted elements should appear. For example:
            <pre>
                h1 {
                    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
                    text-align: center;
                    color: darkblue;
                }
            </pre>
            This rule ensures that all level-one headings on the page use the Arial font, are centered, and appear in dark blue.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cascading aspect of CSS is essential for resolving conflicts when multiple rules apply to the same element. CSS follows a specific hierarchy, with inline styles taking the highest precedence, 
            followed by internal styles (defined in the &lt;style&gt; tag), and then external stylesheets. Within these sources, specificity and the order in which the rules are defined further determine which styles are applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            To achieve responsive designs, developers use CSS features like flexbox and grid. These layout systems allow elements to adapt and rearrange themselves based on the screen size and resolution. Media queries, 
            another powerful feature, enable developers to apply styles conditionally. For instance:
            <pre>
                @media (max-width: 768px) {
                    body {
                        background-color: lightgray;
                    }
                }
            </pre>
            This rule changes the background color to light gray when the screen width is 768 pixels or less, ensuring a better viewing experience on smaller devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Modern CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS further simplify the design process by providing pre-built components and utility classes. These frameworks allow developers to create beautiful, 
            responsive designs with minimal effort. By combining creativity with CSS, developers can bring their visions to life and deliver exceptional user experiences.
